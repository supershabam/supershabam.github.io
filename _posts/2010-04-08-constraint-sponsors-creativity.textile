How many times have you wanted to say something on Twitter but had to rephrase it because of the 140 character restriction?

I recently tried to tweet a very short story (inspired by "@veryshortstory":http://twitter.com/veryshortstory.) I knew exactly what situation I wanted to portray, but my natural wording exceeded 140 characters. Twitter's size constraint forced me to rethink my story: I dropped unnecessary words; I chose the shortest, most descriptive words; I hit backspace many times.

If Twittter allowed 230 characters, I would have been satisfied with my first version and given no extra thought, but I am much more pleased with the Twitterable version of my story, than my too-long-for-Twitter version.
